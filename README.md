# Backend from First Principles

This repository contains backend engineering concepts taught from **first principles**, focusing on ideas that apply universally across languages, frameworks, and tech stacks.

Taught by https://www.youtube.com/@sriniously

The goal is to understand *why* backend systems are built the way they are — not just *how* to use a specific tool.

I am taking notes by hand in Notion as I follow along the course, and converting them to clean MD files with AI to simplify and make clearer.

I think my personal notes are better with more thoughtful explanations, but if you want fast concepts the cleansed ones work well.
